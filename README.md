# Data Structures Final Project (Python)

This repository contains my **final project for the Data Structures course**.  
It is a menu-driven Python program demonstrating key data structures and algorithms through practical tasks.

## Topics Covered

### 1) Searching
- Binary Search (performed on a sorted list)

### 2) Sorting
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort (using a custom Max Heap)
- Step-by-step output to show intermediate states

### 3) Stacks & Expression Processing
- Parentheses validation using a Stack
- Tokenization of arithmetic expressions
- Infix → Postfix conversion
- Infix → Prefix conversion
- Intermediate stack/output states are printed for learning purposes

### 4) Heaps
- Custom Max Heap implementation
- Purchasing priority management (selecting the best offer)

### 5) Graphs (BFS)
- BFS traversal on an adjacency matrix
- Currency communication network analysis
- Prints queue states during traversal

### 6) Undo System (Stack)
- Shopping cart management with Undo functionality

## Files
- `main.py` — main menu and implementations
- `currency_list.csv` — currency codes dataset used in the project (columns: `code`, `name`)

## How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed:

```bash
python main.py
